# excel-lite
A boring console app that does simple excel like things.
I'm using this as opportunity to familiarize myself with lens & parsec.

# To Do

- Don't display redundant parentheses
- Vertically align expression cells with output cells
- Implement quit command
- Evaluate expressions at prompt
- Implement clear cell command
