# excel-lite
A boring console app that does simple excel like things.
I'm using this as opportunity to familiarize myself with lens & parsec.

# To Do
- Don't display redundant parentheses
- Implement edit cell command
- Implement toggle command to toggle between: raw text input, expressions, & values
- Make sheet 2d
